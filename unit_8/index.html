	<h2>Help make Covering The Corridor sustainable</h2>
	<p>When I created Covering The Corridor in early 2016, I hoped to create an online news site not unlike the community newspapers I read growing up. Those papers were a crucial part of the community, keeping tabs on local  government, teaching history, highlighting community members, telling us who won the football game and what new restaurant was coming to the neighborhood.</p>
	<p>But those papers have almost all faded away, and often little has filled the void. With this site, I set out to help fill some of that gap, and create an online news site that valued an area that facinated me: Richmond Highway.</p> 
<p>Since then the site has produced regular updates and tried to an accurate and unflinching. Thousands of people have followed on social media, </p>
	<p>None of this would be possible without the help of the community, as well as friends and former colleagues who have contributed to the site's development.  With the help of many others. We are the only online-only news source delivering timely, useful information about this area.</p>
	<p>But figuring out a way to make Covering The Corridor a sustainable website has proven difficult. Over the past year, I've come to the realization that the site has no chance of survival without reader contributions. Thineeds your help.
